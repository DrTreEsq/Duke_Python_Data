Kaze, A CLI for Dataset Dependencies in ML Projects |image1|
============================================================

What is Kaze?
-------------

Have you downloaded a supervised-learning code-block base, and wish someone
has specified how to download the dataset needed?

``Kaze`` is a CLI for managing dataset dependencies in ML projects. It
is a simple, yet powerful tool for managing dataset dependencies in your
project. It is designed to be used in a way that is similar to ``yarn``
or ``npm``, but with a focus on the ``dataset`` dependency.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install kaze

Example Usage
-------------

To download a dataset, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   kaze add -n flowers https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/\~vgg/data/flowers/102/102flowers.tgz --images $DATASETS/jpg

this will populate your ``.kaze.yml`` file with the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   datasets:
     - name: flowers
       source: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/102flowers.tgz
       images: $DATASETS/jpg

You can also add a dataset from a local file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   kaze add mnist.zip

Usage and Examples
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   ❯ kaze --help
   Usage: kaze [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   Options:
     --help  Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     add
     list

``kaze list``

.. code-block:: bash

   ❯ kaze list
   mnist at /Users/ge/kaze_debug/mnist

``kaze add ...``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   ❯ kaze add --help
   Usage: kaze add [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]

   Options:
     -n, --name TEXT
     -o, --path TEXT    target location for the dataset

     --labels TEXT      label path
     --voice TEXT       voice path
     --video TEXT       video path
     -q, --quiet        Verbose mode
     -z, --unzip        Decompress the dataset
     -v, --verbose      Verbose mode
