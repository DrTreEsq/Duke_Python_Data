##### Create a SQLite Database and Store Data
###### Use the SQLite Operations notebook to connect and create a SQlite database. Go through the cells to create a table and see what happens when you try to create the same table again.

###### Finally populate the database and load data into it, verifying that the data exists.

#### Querying a SQLite Database
##### Use the notebook to create a new databases, populate it with data and query it from Python.
###### Go through all the cells and practice using different SQL statements to filter out the data and get different results.
##### Use different conditions to search for distinct paths, like file names that are partially matched.

##### Parse HTML and Persist it to a SQLite Database
* Use the provided Jupyter Notebook and go through all the cells.
* Verify that all works by creating a new connection and querying the database.
* Update the wikipedia-demo project and spider to use some of these techniques to persist data. Next, try parsing all the files in the html directory instead of just one and persist all results. Do you think you can parse other information as well?
* Try parsing the height and the results from all the other athletes, not just the top three places
